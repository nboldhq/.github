At nBold, like most tech companies, we depend on open source software from all over the world to help us get things done.

We're grateful to the open source community, the projects, and especially their maintainers who have allowed us to innovate and make our customers working lives a little bit more enjoyable.

Listed within this GitHub org, you'll find a collection of things built by nBold, which we think folks may find helpful or inspiring.  
In addition to publishing open source projects, nBold strives to actively participate in improving upon the core frameworks nBold is built upon.

To read more about the exciting work we're doing, check out our [Blog](https://nbold.co/blog).  
If you're looking for nBold developer resources, tools, and SDKs, you'll want to check out the developers section from our [Docs](https://docs.nbold.co/api) website.
